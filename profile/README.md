## 👨‍💻 Core development team
The core team is composed of the following contributors:

### Marco [@MJDeligan](https://github.com/MJDeligan)
`🟢 core full stack contributor`

Marco implemented over 80% of the application just by himself.

He took the responsibility of designing the application's architecture and implementing the backend entirely by himself. He first explained his ideas clearly with multiple process diagrams and database schemas that helped us understand the real time processes that this application is built on and then proceeded to implement the Postgres database, Postgres CRON jobs, API via Supabase, Lambda functions, RPCs, DB Constraints etc. After that he almost single handedly implemented all real time features in the frontend and optimized the UI/UX. Awesome stuff!

### Stefan [@stefnotch](https://github.com/stefnotch)
`🟢 core frontend contributor`

Stefan is the most knowledgeable frontend developer in the team. He reviewed every single of our pull requests, helped us get a better understanding of advanced Vue.js concepts and taught newcomers everything they needed to know about our technology stack with great patience.

After Marco was done with the backend, he set up the project's frontend and developed huge chunks of it just by himself.
He also optimized the performance by reducing the bundle size of the app and considered many security and usability related issues that had a significant impact.

### Yahya [@sueszli](https://github.com/sueszli)
`🟢 core full stack contributor, project manager`

Yahya had the initial idea for this project. This is his second attempt based on a previous iteration called [DateWatch](https://github.com/sueszli/datewatch). He defined all necessary features for this MVP, created all mockups by himself and then designed the app's database and architecture with Marco after which he wrote the lambda functions and many parts of the frontend.

He kept the bigger picture at all times, worked tightly with the team and managed the project effectively.
