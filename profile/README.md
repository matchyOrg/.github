We're a team commited to creating an awesome speed dating experience with our app [Matchy](https://github.com/matchyOrg/matchy).

This is our second attempt based on a previous iteration called [DateWatch](https://github.com/sueszli/datewatch).

We really hope that this app brings you joy and helps you make fun memories and lasting relationships.
