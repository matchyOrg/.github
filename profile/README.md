## Hi there 👋
We're a team commited to creating the ultimate speed dating experience with our open source web app [Matchy](https://github.com/matchyOrg/matchy).

Since our app is still in development feel free to put it on your watchlist / give it a star so you stay up to date with the development process!

We really hope that this project brings you joy and helps you make fun memories and lasting relationships.

## 👨‍💻 The Devs
The development team is currently composed of the following main contributors:

### Marco [@MJDeligan](https://github.com/MJDeligan)
`🟢 core contributor, project lead`

Marco implemented over 80% of the application just by himself.

He took the responsibility of designing the application's architecture and implementing the backend entirely by himself. He first explained his ideas clearly with multiple process diagrams and database schemas that helped us understand the real time processes that this application is built on and then proceeded to implement the Postgres database, Postgres CRON jobs, API via Supabase, Lambda functions, RPCs, DB Constraints etc. After that he almost single handedly implemented all real time features in the frontend. Awesome stuff!

### Stefan [@stefnotch](https://github.com/stefnotch)
`🟢 frontend contributor, reviewer`

Stefan is the most knowledgeable frontend developer in the team. He reviewed every single of our pull requests and helped us get a better understanding of advanced Vue.js concepts.

He helped us get started with the project and consistently managed all dependency so the build size stays small and the application stays fast. He always found the most elegant and solutions to our UI / UX problems.

### Yahya [@sueszli](https://github.com/sueszli)
`🟢 project manager`

Yahya had the initial idea for this project and this is his second attempt to implement this application based on [DateWatch](https://github.com/sueszli/datewatch).

After defining the necessary features for this MVP and designing the mockups on Figma, Yahya gathered all his friends to team up and kick off.
He learned a lot from the more experienced developers, kept the bigger picture at all times and managed the project effectively.

### Daniel [@Fancy11111](https://github.com/Fancy11111)
`🟢 frontend contributor`

Daniel has the most experience in the software industry from the people in our team. He developed essential features reliably and with high quality.
